# Hi, I'm Gamal Hafez 👋

I’m a recent graduate from a business college, and I’m now shifting my career to become a web developer. I began my journey by learning **programming fundamentals using Python**, and built several small projects, including interactive games with Turtle graphics. 

After gaining confidence with Python, I shifted my focus to **web development**, where I’m now building a solid foundation in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. I'm passionate about technology and love creating things that are both useful and user-friendly.
